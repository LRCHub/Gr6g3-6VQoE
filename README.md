[00:11.32] Fighting flames of fire
[00:14.06] Hang onto burning wires
[00:16.77] We don't care anymore
[00:27.27] 
[00:21.72] Are we fading lovers?
[00:24.65] We keep wasting colors
[00:27.25] Maybe we should let this go
[00:40.75] 
[00:31.83] We're fallin' apart, still we hold together
[00:37.29] We've passed the end, so we chase forever
[00:42.44] 'Cause this is all we know
[00:47.70] This feeling's all we know
[01:00.70] 
[00:52.52] I'll ride my bike up to the road
[00:55.55] Down the streets, right through the city
[00:58.48] I'll go everywhere you go
[01:00.75] From Chicago to the coast
[01:13.25] 
[01:03.24] You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
[01:06.14] Blow the smoke right through the window"
[01:09.28] 'Cause this is all we know
[01:22.28] 
[01:22.55] 'Cause this is all we know
[01:33.15] 'Cause this is all we know
[01:46.15] 
[01:36.47] Never face each other
[01:39.12] One bed, different covers
[01:41.82] We don't care anymore
[01:52.32] 
[01:47.01] Two hearts still beating
[01:49.94] On with different rhythms
[01:52.57] Maybe we should let this go
[02:06.07] 
[01:57.22] We're fallin' apart, still we hold together
[02:02.62] We've passed the end, so we chase forever
[02:07.73] 'Cause this is all we know
[02:13.11] This feeling's all we know
[02:26.11] 
[02:17.87] I'll ride my bike up to the road
[02:20.82] Down the streets, right through the city
[02:23.44] I'll go everywhere you go
[02:26.14] From Chicago to the coast
[02:38.64] 
[02:28.38] You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
[02:31.55] Blow the smoke right through the window"
[02:34.49] 'Cause this is all we know
[02:47.49] 
[02:47.84] 'Cause this is all we know
[02:58.60] 'Cause this is all we know
